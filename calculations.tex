\chapter{Calculations}

\section{Introduction}
The calculations of various parameters are at the core of the braking system design and are necessary for us to select the specific models of the components of the braking system. Adding to that, they were needed to decide the dimensions of the components we designed and manufactured. Furthermore, they gave us a clear estimate of our vehicle's performance in the tests and events.
To begin with the calculations regarding the braking system they had to be categorized as :-
\textbf{Dynamics Of Braking}\\
It covers the behavior of the vehicle during braking and the behavior during peak deceleration was considered.
\textbf{Brake fluid volume calculations}\\
This part comes into picture due to need of brake fluid volume requirements for various components have to be met in order to assure that the brake pads make good contact with the brake rotors and apply the large enough force we desire.
