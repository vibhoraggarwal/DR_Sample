\chapter{Pedal Assembly}

\section{Introduction}
The brake pedal applies an input force from driver's foot to the braking system. Design and construction of this part greatly effects how a brake system operates and how the driver feels.Long pedals reduce the pedal force required to stop a vehicle. However, long pedals have long travel. They can feel spongy to the driver. The b
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.] High machinability
\item[2.] High strength
\item[3.] Good weldability
\item[4.] Low cost because of easy manufacturability
\item[5.] Yield strength($3.51*10^2 \ N/m^2$) is also higher than aluminum
\end{enumerate}
