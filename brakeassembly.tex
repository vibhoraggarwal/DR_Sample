\section{Master Cylinder Mount}
The master cylinder mount has to be designed very carefully as it experiences a very large force perpendicular to itself and therefore has a very large tendency to bend.\\
\textbf{Material Selection}\\
As the main point for material selection is strength of the mount and weight, aluminum of thickness 4mm is used.\\
\textbf{Design}\\
The master cylinder mount has to be designed such that it can withstand large forces. Therefore, we have attached plates perpendicular to the main mount and appropriate analysis has been carried out on CAD models. It was designed to give a brake bias ratio along with the balance bar in order to keep the pushrods straight.
